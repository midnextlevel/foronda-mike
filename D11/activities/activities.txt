// Step 2: In MongoDB Compass, create a new database called "Bookstore" and a collection called "Books".

// Step 3: Perform the following CRUD operations using MongoDB Compass:

// a) Create Operation:
// Insert at least three book documents with different fields such as title, author, genre, and publication year.
db.Books.insertMany([
    {
        title: "To Kill a Mockingbird",
        author: "Harper Lee",
        genre: "Fiction",
        publishedYear: 1960
    },
    {
        title: "1984",
        author: "George Orwell",
        genre: "Dystopian",
        publishedYear: 1949
    },
    {
        title: "The Great Gatsby",
        author: "F. Scott Fitzgerald",
        genre: "Classic",
        publishedYear: 1925
    }
]);

// b) Read Operation:
// Retrieve all the book documents in the "Books" collection.
db.Books.find();

// Retrieve a specific book document based on its title or author.
db.Books.find({ title: "1984" },{_id:0});
db.Books.find({ author: "George Orwell" },{_id:0});

// c) Update Operation:
// Update the genre of a book document.
db.Books.updateOne(
    { title: "1984" },
    { $set: { genre: "Science Fiction" } }
);

// Update the publication year of a book document.
db.Books.updateOne(
    { title: "The Great Gatsby" },
    { $set: { publishedYear: 1926 } }
);

// d) Delete Operation:
// Delete a book document based on its title or author.
db.Books.deleteOne({ title: "To Kill a Mockingbird" });
db.Books.deleteOne({ author: "George Orwell" });

// Step 4: After each operation, verify the changes by re-reading the data from the "Books" collection.
